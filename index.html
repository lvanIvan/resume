      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>After a career spent mostly working on small, highly focused startup teams, I started looking at ways to bring that level of skill and passion to the broader community via outreach and events.</p>
      <p>I have always put an emphasis on choosing the simplest, most robust solution. Fitting the appropriate technology to the project requirements is crucial to ensuring reliability, security, and accessibility.</p>
      <p>Lately I am trying to bring the rigor of true engineering to software development as a means of reducing defects, thus increasing the reliability and security of today’s and tomorrow’s systems.</p>
